    <h3>IDs and Classes DEMO</h3>
    <div id="mainBox" class="redbg">This is mainBox.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <b>IDs are exclusive. </b>One item can have only One ID and One ID can be
      assigned to only one Item. Means Each Item can have only one
      <b>UNIQUE ID.</b>
      <br />
      But <b>Class is not exclusive.</b> Which means a single class can be
      assigned to multiple Items and a single Item can also have
      <b>Multiple Classes.</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      For Example: <br />
      <p>
        &emsp; &lt;div id="mainBox" class="redbg"><br />
        &emsp; &emsp; This is mainBox.<br />&emsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />&emsp;
        &lt;div id="mainBox" class="redbg"><br />&emsp; &emsp; This is second
        mainBox.<br />
        &emsp; &lt;/div> <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; This is not
        a valid practice.<br /><br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But<br /><br /><br />&emsp;
        &lt;div id="mainBox1" class="redbg"><br />&emsp; &emsp; This is
        mainBox.<br />&emsp; &lt;/div><br /><br />&emsp; &lt;div id="mainBox2"
        class="redbg blackBorder"><br />&emsp; &emsp; This is second mainBox.<br />&emsp;
        &lt;/div><br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;These is a Valid
        Practice.

      <!-- Here we used html entities to format the page which looks very unprofessional but we have not started CSS, we should use margins, padding etc to format and style the page. But here I used Entities to have a practice. -->
    </div>
    <p>
      **********IDs are generally used to Identify the item in JavaScript, which
      is why the can not be duplicated as that would be a problem for the
      algorithm, but the classes are used by the CSS which can be duplicated as
      Multiple Items can have same style or a Single Item can Have Multiple
      Styles applied to it.***********
